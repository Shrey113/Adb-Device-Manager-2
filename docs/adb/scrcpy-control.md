# Scrcpy Control

## About

This feature provides a centralized interface to manage and customize the underlying Scrcpy commands used for **Screen Mirroring**, **Audio Streaming**, and **Input Control**.

Instead of relying on default settings, you can:
- Customize the generated code and arguments for Scrcpy.
- Fine-tune command parameters for performance or quality.
- Manage how the Scrcpy process is initiated and controlled.

This gives you full transparency and control over exactly how your device is being mirrored and controlled via ADB.
