# 🧭 ADB Device Manager 2 — Code of Conduct

Welcome to the **ADB Device Manager 2** community!

Like the broader open-source world, our community is made up of developers, testers, designers, and contributors from diverse backgrounds — working together to build seamless Android ↔ Windows integration.

Our diversity is a strength, but it can also present communication challenges.  
To ensure a positive and productive environment, we’ve outlined a few ground rules.  
These are not meant to be exhaustive, but to provide clear guidance on how to interact constructively.

## 🌍 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all **community spaces** managed by the **ADB Device Manager 2** project, including (but not limited to):

- GitHub discussions, issues, and pull requests  
- Project repositories and documentation  
- Community chat, forums, or events (virtual or in-person)  
- Any communication channels under the project’s name  

Behavior that occurs outside these spaces may also affect participation if it impacts community safety.

## 💬 Our Standards

To foster a welcoming and collaborative environment:

### ✅ Be Friendly and Patient
We’re all here to learn and contribute. Offer help when you can, and assume good intentions in others.

### 🌈 Be Welcoming
We strive to include and support people of all backgrounds and identities.  
This includes — but isn’t limited to — members of any:

- Race, ethnicity, or national origin  
- Culture, color, or immigration status  
- Gender identity or expression  
- Sexual orientation  
- Age, size, family status, or ability  
- Religion, belief, or political opinion  

### 🤝 Be Considerate
Your work will affect others, and theirs will affect you. Think through the impact of your actions and decisions.  
Remember that not everyone communicates in the same language or tone.

### 🙏 Be Respectful
Disagreements happen — but rudeness, hostility, or dismissive comments are not acceptable.  
Healthy debate and feedback are encouraged; personal attacks are not.

### 🗣️ Choose Your Words Carefully
We’re professionals. Treat others with kindness.  
Harassment or exclusionary behavior of any kind will not be tolerated, including:

- Threats, insults, or violent language  
- Discriminatory remarks or jokes  
- Sharing explicit or offensive material  
- Doxxing (posting personal info without consent)  
- Unwelcome sexual attention  
- Encouraging or supporting harassment  

If someone asks you to stop, **stop immediately**.

### 💡 When We Disagree, Seek Understanding
Technical and personal disagreements happen.  
Our strength comes from diverse perspectives — listen carefully and aim for constructive resolution.  
Assume mistakes are made in good faith, and focus on learning, not blaming.
